			<h2>ENERGY</h2>
				<p>Guayusa gives you a unique kind of energy, different from what you get 
				from coffee or traditional energy drinks. We think of it as “clean energy” 
				– it’s how we describe what Amazonian hunters call the “mental strength and 
				courage” they get from drinking guayusa.</p>
				<p>The compounds in guayusa give you sustained and focused energy. There
				 are no harsh chemicals. No feeling burned out later. Just organic, healthy
				energy from a leaf. Drink guayusa to get the energy you want now without
				sacrificing how you feel later. Not all energy is created equal – keep yours clean.</p>
			<h2>HEALTH</h2>
				<p>Guayusa contains twice the antioxidants of green tea. These compounds 
				neutralize free radicals and may help prevent premature aging. It also contains 
				chlorogenic acids, which have been reported to contribute to cardiovascular health, 
				help reduce high blood pressure, and regulate body weight. In addition,
				 guayusa contains 15 essential amino acids and has ferulic acid, which can 
				 help improve blood circulation. </p>	
			<h2>GROWING</h2>
				<p>Guayusa is grown in biodiverse agroforestry plots, or chakras. To the 
				untrained eye, these ‘forest gardens’ look like pristine natural rainforest,
				 though, to the farmers who cultivate them, they are highly managed agricultural 
				 plots combining a diverse mix of plants. Guayusa is a shade-grown plant –
				leaning it needs the shade of other trees to fully develop – and flourishes
				 in this setting. </p>
				<p>After a long history of cultivation, guayusa no longer naturally reproduces.
				 New trees are planted from cuttings. This process involves taking part of a branch 
				 from an existing tree and placing it in rich soil. New cuttings reach productivity 
				 approximately 3 years after planting, when they grow to a height of about 8 feet.</p>
				<p>Runa regularly purchases fresh leaves from Kichwa farmers. We then dry and 
				mill the leaves in our processing facility in the small town of Archidona, in
				 the Napo Province of Ecuador. The leaves are air-dried (we do not use burning 
				 wood in the drying process).</p>
