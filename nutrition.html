   		  		<h3><p> is a native Amazonian super-leaf that gives you clean energy by
   		  		 balancing as much energny as a cup of coffee with double the polyphenol
   		  		 antioxidants of leading green tea products. Indigenous people in the 
   		  		 Ecuadorian Amazon have brewed guavas like tea for thousands of years as
   		  		 an essential part of what makes them "Runa" fully alive. Unlike 
   		  		 traditional teas, it contains no tannins, so it tastes surprisingly
   		  		 smooth and naturally sweet.</p></h3>
